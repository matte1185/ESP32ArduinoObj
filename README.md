# ESP32ArduinoObj
Esp32 Object identification with Arduino Led Turning On And Off


First, you need to take photos (photo acquisition) and upload them to Edge Impulse. Then, you need to change the labels to your own and set up your PIN on Arduino, as well as your IP and user details. First, upload the code to Arduino, then upload the other codes to the ESP32. Finally, start the script and create a batch file to run the script in a loop every 2-3 seconds.

If anyone needs assistance or has any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at @matte1185. I'm always available to provide support and help with the project.
